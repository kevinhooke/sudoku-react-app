    <h1>Kevin's Sudoku Puzzles</h1>
    <p>Solve the randomly loaded puzzle, or load a new puzzle with the buttons below.</p>
    <p>Use pencil controls on the right to enter pencil marks, or unselect pencil to enter a guess.</p>

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <h3>The Solver</h3>
    <p>This is a React web client to a Java based AWS Lambda that solves Sudoku puzzles.
    The content of the grid is sent to the Lambda, and if there is a single, unique solution,
    it is returned and displayed in the grid.</p>
    <p>The Solver uses my implementation of Donald Knuth's
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">
        Algorithm X</a> and Dancing Links implemented in Java, which you can find
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-solver-with-dlx">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>The Puzzle Generator and Human Ranker</h3>
      <p>The puzzles are generated by a scheduled Lambda that runs a couple of times of day. The solver (above)
        is used to check that a puzzle is valid, only valid puzzles are kept. In order to rate the difficulty of
        the generated puzzles, another Lambda attempts to solve the puzzles using human approaches (not using
        the Algorithm X approach above), looking for naked and hidden singles (easy), pairs (medium), or if a
        puzzle can't be solved with either of those approaches then I'm currently defaulting those to hard.
