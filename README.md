This is a React frontend using Redux for a Sudoku puzzle app. It evolved from a previous app which was a frontend for a collection of AWS Lambdas
which provided a Sudoku solver, a puzzle generator and human difficulty rander and puzzle retrieve. The previous version is here:
https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-solver-react-app-with-redux

This project is an evolution of that same app to allow the user to play the puzzle, using established approaches like using
pencil notes per square. It also includes the integration with the solver and feature to load generated sample projects.

This is currently an in progress project.
