This is a React frontend using Redux for a Sudoku puzzle app. It evolved from a previous React app (https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-solver-react-app-with-redux) which was a frontend for a collection of AWS Lambdas
which provided a Sudoku solver (using Donald Knuth's DLX and Algorithm X : https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-solver-with-dlx), a puzzle generator (https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-generator) and human difficulty ranker (https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-human-grader) and puzzle retriever (https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-getpuzzles-lambda).


This project is an evolution of that same app to allow the user to play the puzzle, using established approaches like using
pencil notes per square. It also includes the integration with the solver and feature to load generated sample projects.

This is currently an in progress project.
